# My Portfolio - Viduni Hewage

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project showcases my skills, projects, and experiences as a software engineer and web developer.

## 💼 About This Portfolio

I built this using **Astro JS** for a modern, fast, and SEO-friendly structure, **Tailwind CSS** for responsive and clean design, and **TypeScript** to ensure type safety and maintainable code.
